       <p>Every year on April 22, Earth Day marks the anniversary of the birth of the modern 
           environmental movement in 1970.
       There is no question that Earth has been a giving planet. Everything humans have needed to survive, and thrive, 
       was provided by the natural world around us: food, water, medicine, materials for 
       shelter, and even natural cycles such as climate and nutrients.Earth Day seems as good a day as any to remind ourselves what nature gives us free-of-charge.
        Here then is a selective sampling of nature’s importance to our lives:</p>

            <h2 style="color:chocolate ;text-decoration: underline;"> Effects of  Deforestration:</h3>
                <p>Deforestation is the clearing, destroying, or otherwise removal of trees through deliberate, natural, 
                    or accidental means. It can occur in any area densely populated by trees and other plant life, 
                    but the majority of it is currently happening in the Amazon rainforest.</p>
                    <p>The loss of trees and other vegetation can cause climate change, desertification, 
                        soil erosion, fewer crops, flooding, increased greenhouse gases in 
                        the atmosphere, and a host of problems for indigenous people.</p>
